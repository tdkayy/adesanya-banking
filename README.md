## 🤖 Introduction

This project integrates with the Expensify API to create a personal finance tracker that visualizes expense history, spending habits, and budget breakdowns. It’s built with React + TypeScript and styled with Tailwind for speed and clarity.

I created this dashboard to simplify how I review expenses — not just by date, but by meaning.
